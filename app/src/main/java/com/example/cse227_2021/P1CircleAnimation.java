/*P11PropertyAnimation allows you to animate almost any property of an object. You can define an animation to change
 any object property (a field in an object) over time, regardless of whether the change draws
  to the screen or not. A property animation changes a property's value over a specified length
  of time.For example, you can animate a circle to grow bigger by increasing its radius.*/

/*
Create a custom View that includes a radius property.
Create simple radius-based animations using ObjectAnimator objects.
Combine and sequence animations using an AnimatorSet object.

/*
1. Create an app with a single activity(P11JAvaAnimation) and a P11PropertyAnimation custom view.
2. Add an mradius property to the P11PropertyAnimation class and a setRadius() "setter" method for that custom property. The Animator instance will call the setRadius() method to change the size of mradius during the animation.
3. Override the onDraw() method to draw a circle of size mradius. The circle is created at the place where the user taps.
4. Create two Animator instances for the radius property.
5. Use an AnimatorSet to play the animations in sequence after the user taps the screen.
